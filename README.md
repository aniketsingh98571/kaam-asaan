# KAAM ASAAN - A Decentralised Government portal for applying to Government Schemes : - A Web3 Hackathon Project

## Problem Statement - In today's time, people want things to be done quickly without any hassle. So when it comes to applying for any government scheme on the government portal, we tend to sit back just because we know the process will take a long time, why a long time? 
Well, 
1. You must apply for the scheme by filling out the application. 
2. It gets allocated to an officer [which you don't know, to whom the application gets assigned?]    
3. You keep checking your application's status on the government portal.
4. You don't know whether the officer who is handling your application has a good track record of work or not?
5. Your data can be altered, you may not know ;)
6. Citizens should also have the right about whether the government is doing its job properly or not.

A lot of problems right?

Well, we are here to solve all these problems with the help of "KAAM ASAAN"

## Solution:-
1. With the help of kaam asaan, you will first fill out the application form.
2. After you submit your application, your data will be stored on IPFS so that no one can alter it, and it's safe.
3. You can check, which officer is allocated for your scheme by visiting your profile page and checking the applied scheme
4. You can also see the track record of a government employee from his profile.
5. Accountability and transparency of work
6. The second main reason behind building this platform is that for applying to schemes they will follow a traditional web3 procedure which will help them to understand how blockchain works, how their data is stored, how a transaction is processed etc.
